# Cloud-Native CI/CD Pipeline with Kubernetes Assignment

This repository contains my solution for the **CSCI 5409 Cloud Computing** assignment focused on building a cloud-native application with a CI/CD pipeline and deploying it to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

## Assignment Overview

In this assignment, I built a cloud-native application using containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). The main objectives of the assignment were:

- Containerize two microservices that interact with each other.
- Create a CI/CD pipeline using GCP tools to deploy the services to GKE.
- Configure persistent volumes for the GKE cluster to store and retrieve file data.
- Utilize Kubernetes tools like kubectl to manage and monitor the GKE cluster.
- Learn and apply Terraform to create and manage the GKE cluster infrastructure.
- Showcase the complete workflow through a video submission.

## What I Learned

Through this assignment, I gained hands-on experience and understanding of the following concepts:

- Containerization using Docker to encapsulate applications and dependencies.
- Building a CI/CD pipeline using GCP tools like Cloud Source Repository, Cloud Build, and Artifact Registry.
- Creating Kubernetes clusters using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) both through the GCP console and with Terraform.
- Deploying microservices to GKE and managing them using kubectl.
- Working with persistent volumes to store and retrieve data within a Kubernetes cluster.
- Developing REST APIs that communicate between containers.
- Effective usage of YAML files to define Kubernetes resources.
- Practical application of infrastructure-as-code (IaC) principles using Terraform.
- Video creation and presentation skills, demonstrating the entire process from cluster creation to deployment.
